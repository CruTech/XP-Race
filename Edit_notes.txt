Go through concrete powder recipes and make them actual recipes so they stop throwing error messages.

summon minecraft:armor_stand ~ 150 ~ {CustomName:"\"Setup\""}
Add ^ to spawn at 00 high enough to land on top of the hub and clear the way for it, or to land on created block at y=250
Test for it at appropriate position to auto trigger field gen stage 2

Replace hub slabs with blocks, causes server to think players are flying.

add "/trigger start" and "/trigger end" triggers and functions

figure out way to run multiple rounds on same world.
  could run more games of fewer teams (2 games of 4 teams or 4 games of 2 teams)
  could generate more platforms further out. could allow for near infinite games. would need to change to relative positioning
    starting at 00 go out in 8 striaght lines
    after each round, kill previous marker, rename current marker ("<Colour> Base Old"), generate new marker ("<Colour> Base").
      May need to spawn new marker to show old, rather than rename
