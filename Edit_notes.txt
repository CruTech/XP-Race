function main/clear
	clear inventory and scores of players, set gamemode survival, tp to hub
function ?/team_change
	empty all teams, reset team wins
functions main/countdown/(numerous)
	title with remaining time, schedule next in sequence


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Integrate /schedule to any valid functions

redesign the hub

create book to run commands through

add "/trigger start" and "/trigger end" triggers and functions

figure out way to run multiple rounds on same world.
    starting at 00 go out in 8 striaght lines
    after each round, kill previous marker, rename current marker ("•<Colour> Origin•" (alt-7)), generate new marker ("◘<Colour> Base◘" (alt-8)).
      May need to spawn new marker to show old, rather than rename




Game process:
> Admin gets bedrock
> replace bedrock with book
> generate hub
> summon 8 Origin markers above hub
> select number of teams [2,8] stored to scoreboard on ♦Admin♦ (alt-4) dummy player
> select game duration stored on scoreboard on ♦Admin♦
> based on selected number of teams, load chunks relative to Origin markers
> clear path to terrain, summon gravity tester, schedule next function in 5 seconds
> generate platforms and create Base markers
	> /execute if block ~ ~-1 ~ water run setblock ~ ~ ~1 chest{Items:[{Slot:0,id:oak_boat,Count:1},{Slot:1,id:oak_boat,Count:1},{Slot:2,id:oak_boat,Count:1}]}
	> kill Origin markers, remove force load on chunks relative to Base marker
> start game:
	> assign unassigned players randomly
	> clear player inventories
	> tp players to platforms
	> show start screen
	> based on duration scoreboard schedule corresponding countdown function
		> displays remaining time and schedules next countdown function
	> last countdown schedules end function, also available in book, and clears any schedules.
	> score grab using /schedule to itterate
	> {/scoreboard players operation Leader top_score > <Team> xp_score} at end of each score grab
	> run {/execute if score <Team> xp_score = Leader top_score run scoreboard players add <Team> wins 1} for all teams at end of game (reset wins if teams are reassigned)
> from book can create new game
	> clears team scores
	> gives promt that you can select new number of teams/duration
		> unassignes all players if number of teams changed
	> rename (or spawn new and kill old) Base marker to Origin marker, /execute as Base to keep unused original origins
	> platform generation and game start should function as normal from this point

Book commands:
> Generate Hub
> Reset Players (clear inventories and tp to hub)
> Number Of Teams (2,3,4,6,8)
> Give Team Assignment Tokens
> Game Duration (30,45,60,90,120 minutes)

> Start Game
